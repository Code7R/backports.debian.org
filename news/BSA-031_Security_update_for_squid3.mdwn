	Julien Danjou uploaded new packages for squid3 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-2951
	  When IPv6 DNS resolution is not enabled, accesses an invalid socket
	  during an IPv4 TCP DNS query, which allows remote attackers to cause
	  a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via vectors
	  that trigger an IPv4 DNS response with the TC bit set.

	CVE-2010-3072
	  Due to an internal error in string handling Squid is vulnerable to a
	  denial of service attack when processing specially crafted requests.
	  This problem allows any trusted client to perform a denial of service
	  attack on the Squid service.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.1.6-1.2~bpo50+1.

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
