	Andreas Metzler uploaded new packages for exim4 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-4345 exim privilege escalation
	  Exim 4.72 and earlier allows local users to gain privileges by
	  leveraging the ability of the exim user account to specify an
	  alternate configuration file with a directive that contains
	  arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by the spool_directory
	  directive.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problem has been fixed in
	version 4.72-3~bpo50+1.

	For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
	version 4.69-9+lenny2.

	For the upcoming stable version (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
	(sid), this problems has been fixed in version 4.72-3.

	For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
	version 4.73~rc1-1.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository to
	200 so that new versions of installed backports will be installed
	automatically.
