Hi all, 
I'm proud to announce the start of the lenny-backports distribution. All 
contributors are now asked to provide new backports also for lenny-backports.
But that does not mean etch-backports is dead, we will continue support for  
etch-backports as long as there is security support for oldstable (aka etch).
But remember that contributors are now allowed to add packages to etch-bpo which 
have a higher version than in lenny (because they are allowed to add versions
from squeeze). So it is possible that there is no clean upgrade path from 
etch + backports to lenny. If you don't want this please upgrade to lenny 
or stop installing new package versions from etch-backports. 
Thanks to the unoffical buildd network we are also able to provide autobuild
packages for the following architectures: arm, armel, amd64, powerpc, i386, ia64
and alpha. Possibly mips and sparc will follow. You can find more 
informations about the buildstatus of a package at the [buildd webinterface](http://buildd.ayous.org).

Thanks for your attention 
Alex - ftp-master of backports.org
