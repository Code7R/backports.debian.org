	 Following the removal of the egroupware packages from testing and
	unstable because they were unmaintained and have outstanding unaddressed
	security issues for a while the packages got now removed from
	lenny-backports, too.

	 If you have installed the egroupware suite please be aware that they
	aren't maintained since a long while now and do contain some more
	severse security issues. Unfortunately I'm not aware of a replacement to
	suggest, so you either will have to track the groupware suite yourself
	or look for an alternative.

	 Sorry for the inconvenience,
	Rhonda
