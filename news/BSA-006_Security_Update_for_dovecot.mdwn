	Marco Nenciarini uploaded new packages for dovecot which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-3706
	  plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and
	  2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to
	  the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive
	  to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain
	  circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows
	  remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via
	  a request to read or modify a mailbox.

	CVE-2010-3707
	  plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and
	  2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to
	  the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive
	  to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain
	  circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less
	  specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass
	  intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a
	  mailbox.

	CVE-2010-3779
	  Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the
	  admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public
	  namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass
	  intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as
	  demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.

	  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3779

	CVE-2010-3780
	  Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to
	  cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously
	  disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.

	  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3780

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.2.15-1~bpo50+1.

	For the current testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, the
	problem has been fixed in version 1.2.15-1.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.
