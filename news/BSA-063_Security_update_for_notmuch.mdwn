	David Bremner uploaded new packages for notmuch which fixed the
	following security problems:

	DSA-2416-1 notmuch -- information disclosure

	When using the Emacs interface, a user could be tricked into replying to
	a maliciously formatted message which could lead to files from the local
	machine being attached to the outgoing message.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version

	        0.11.1~bpo60+1

	For wheezy (testing) and sid (unstable) this was fixed in version

	        0.11.1-1

	For squeeze (stable), this is fixed in version

	        0.3.1+squeeze1
