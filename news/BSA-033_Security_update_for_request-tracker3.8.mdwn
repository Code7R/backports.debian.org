	Jan Wagner uploaded new packages for request-tracker3.8 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-1685
	    If the external custom field feature is enabled, Request Tracker
	    allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with the
	    permissions of the web server, possible triggered by a cross-site
	    request forgery attack.  (External custom fields are disabled by
	    default.)

	    http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1685

	CVE-2011-1686
	    Multiple SQL injection attacks allow authenticated users to obtain
	    data from the database in an unauthorized way.

	    http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1686

	CVE-2011-1687
	    An information leak allows an authenticated privileged user to
	    obtain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the
	    search interface.

	    http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1687

	CVE-2011-1688
	    When running under certain web servers (such as Lighttpd), Request
	    Tracker is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing
	    attackers to read any files accessible to the web server.  Request
	    Tracker instances running under Apache or Nginx are not affected.

	    http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1688

	CVE-2011-1689
	    Request Tracker contains multiple cross-site scripting
	    vulnerabilities.

	    http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1689

	CVE-2011-1690
	    Request Tracker enables attackers to redirect authentication
	    credentials supplied by legitimate users to third-party servers.

	    http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1690

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.8.8-7+squeeze1~bpo50+1.

	For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
	in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze1 of the request-tracker3.8 package.

	For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
	(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.8.10-1 of the
	request-tracker3.8 package.
