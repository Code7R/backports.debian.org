	Jan Wagner uploaded new packages for pidgin which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-3711
	  Fixes multiple remotely-triggered DoSes

	  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3711

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2.7.3-1~bpo50+2.

	For the unstable (sid) distribution, the problem has been fixed in version 
	2.7.4-1, for testing (squeeze) the fix should hopefully follow soon.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically. 

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
