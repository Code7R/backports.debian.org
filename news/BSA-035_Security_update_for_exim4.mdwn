	Andreas Metzler uploaded new packages for exim4 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-1764
	  DKIM related format string vulnerability

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 4.72-6+squeeze1~bpo50+1.

	For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
	version 4.72-6+squeeze1.

	For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
	version 4.75-3.

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.
