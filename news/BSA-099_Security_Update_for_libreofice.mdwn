	Rene Engelhard uploaded new packages for libreoffice which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2014-3693:
	   Use-After-Free in socket manager of Impress Remote

	   It was discovered that LibreOffice 4.0.0 and later does not manage the port
	   1599 for the LibreOffice Impress correctly. An external attackers with
	   access to that port could cause the deleted port manager to continue to
	   process attacker supplied data.

	Note that this update also disables the remote contol per default as it
	listens on port 1599 "to the world" per default. If you want/need it you
	need to enable it manally:
	   1. Open LibreOffice, go to "Tools -> Options..."
	   2. Select "LibreOffice Impress -> General"
	   3. Check "Presentation -> Enable remote control"

	For the wheezy-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1:4.3.3~rc2-1~bpo70+1.
