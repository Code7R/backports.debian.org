	Peter Samuelson uploaded new packages for subversion which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-0715
	  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will dereference
	  a NULL pointer if a lock token is sent in a HTTP request by a
	  Subversion client which has not authenticated to the server.
	  http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-0715-advisory.txt

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.12dfsg-5~bpo50+1.

	For the stable distribution (squeeze) the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.12dfsg-5.

	For the unstable distribution (sid) the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.16dfsg-1. This version is expected to be migrated to the
	testing distribution (wheezy) shortly.

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
