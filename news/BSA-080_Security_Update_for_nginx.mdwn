	I uploaded new packages for nginx which fixed the following security
	problems:

	CVE-2012-4929 - nginx -- vulnerable to CRIME SSL attack

	The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google
	Chrome, Qt, and other products, can encrypt compressed data without
	properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows
	man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by observing
	length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP
	request potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a
	"CRIME" attack.

	Nginx < 1.2.2 is only vulnerable when built with openssl < 1.0.0

	This has been corrected in upstream 1.2.2 version.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version

	    1.2.1-2.2~bpo+60+2

	For Squeeze (stable) this was fixed in version

	    0.7.67-3+squeeze3

	Wheezy (testing) and Sid (unstable) are not vulnerable to this security
	issue.
