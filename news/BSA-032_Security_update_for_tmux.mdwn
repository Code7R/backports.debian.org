	Daniel Danner discovered that tmux, a terminal multiplexer, is not
	properly dropping group privileges. Due to a patch introduced by
	Debian, when invoked with the -S option, tmux is not dropping
	permissions obtained through its setgid installation (CVE-2011-1496).

	For the lenny-backports distribution this problem has been fixed in
	version 1.3-2+squeeze1~bpo50+1.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution this problem has been fixed in
	version 1.4-6~bpo60+1.

	For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
	in version 1.3-2+squeeze1.

	For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
	in version 1.4-6.

	For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1.4-6.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
