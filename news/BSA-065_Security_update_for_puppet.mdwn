	Micah Anderson uploaded new packages for puppet which fixed the
	following security problems: CVE-2012-1053 and CVE-2012-1054

	    CVE-2012-1053

	    Puppet runs execs with an unintended group privileges,
	    potentially leading to privilege escalation.

	    CVE-2012-1054

	    The k5login type writes to untrusted locations, enabling
	    local users to escalate their privileges if the k5login type is
	    used.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2.7.11-1~bpo60+1.
