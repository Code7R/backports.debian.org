	Guido GÃ¼nther uploaded new packages for libvirt which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-2511
	  Integer overflow in VirDomainGetVcpus

	CVE-2011-1486
	  Non thread safe error reporting

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 0.9.2-7~bpo60+1.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 0.8.3-5+squeeze2~bpo50+2.

	For lenny-backports only:

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
