	Gerfried Fuchs uploaded new packages for postgresql-8.4 which fixed the
	following security problem:

	CVE-2010-3433
	  The PL/perl and PL/Tcl implementations in PostgreSQL 7.4 before
	  7.4.30, 8.0 before 8.0.26, 8.1 before 8.1.22, 8.2 before 8.2.18, 8.3
	  before 8.3.12, 8.4 before 8.4.5, and 9.0 before 9.0.1 do not properly
	  protect script execution by a different SQL user identity within the
	  same session, which allows remote authenticated users to gain
	  privileges via crafted script code in a SECURITY DEFINER function, as
	  demonstrated by (1) redefining standard functions or (2) redefining
	  operators, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1168,
	  CVE-2010-1169, CVE-2010-1170, and CVE-2010-1447.

	For the lenny-backports distribution, the problem has been fixed in
	version 1.8.5-1~bpo50+1.

	For the current testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, the
	problem has been fixed in version 1.8.5-1.

	Upgrade instructions
	- --------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
