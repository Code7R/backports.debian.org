	Micah Anderson uploaded new packages for puppet which fixed the following
	security problems:

	CVE-2011-3848
	 Resist directory traversal attacks through indirections.

	 In various versions of Puppet it was possible to cause a directory
	 traversal attack through the SSLFile indirection base class.  This was
	 variously triggered through the user-supplied key, or the Subject of
	 the certificate, in the code.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2.7.1-1~bpo60+2.
