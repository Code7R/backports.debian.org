	 Following the removal of kvm source package from testing and unstable
	because of being obsoleted by qemu-kvm and having a fair amount of
	outstanding security issues since a while the package now got removed
	from lenny-backports, too.

	 If you have installed the kvm and related packages from lenny-backports
	please make sure that you upgrade to the qemu-kvm related ones.

	 Enjoy,
	Rhonda
