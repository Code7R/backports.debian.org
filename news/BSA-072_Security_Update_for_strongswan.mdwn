	Micah Anderson uploaded new packages for strongswan which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2012-2388

	 An authentication bypass issue was discovered by the Codenomicon
	 CROSS project in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN solution. When using
	 RSA-based setups, a missing check in the gmp plugin could allow an
	 attacker presenting a forged signature to successfully authenticate
	 against a strongSwan responder.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 4.5.2-1.4~bpo60+1
