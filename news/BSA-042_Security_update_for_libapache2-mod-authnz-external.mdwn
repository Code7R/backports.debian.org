	Amaya Rodrigo uploaded new packages for libapache2-mod-authnz-external
	which fixed the following security problems:

	CVE-2011-2688
	        Remotely exploitable SQL injection in the mysql auth module.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.2.4-2~bpo50+1.1.

	For the stable distribution (squeeze) the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.2.4-2.1+squeeze1.

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
