	Sven Hoexter uploaded new packages for subversion which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-4539
	  A NULL pointer dereference flaw exisits in mod_dav_svn, the Apache
	  httpd module for the Subversion server, when listing of repositories
	  (SVNListParentPath directive) is enabled. A remote user could use
	  this flaw to cause denial of service (particular httpd thread crash).
	  http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4539

	CVE-2010-4644
	  A server-side memory leak allows remote users to cause a denial
	  of service (memory consumption and daemon outage or crash) via
	  Subversion client "blame" or "log" operations, when the "-g" option
	  (request to display additional merge history) is used.
	  http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4644

	For the lenny-backports distribution, the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.12dfsg-4~bpo50+1.

	For the upcoming stable version (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
	(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.6.12dfsg-4.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
