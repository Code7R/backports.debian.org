	Micah Anderson uploaded new packages for puppet which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-3872
	  Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.12 and 2.7.x before 2.7.6, and Puppet
	  Enterprise (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 before 1.2.4, when signing an
	  agent certificate, adds the Puppet master's certdnsnames values to the
	  X.509 Subject Alternative Name field of the certificate, which allows
	  remote attackers to spoof a Puppet master via a man-in-the-middle
	  (MITM) attack against an agent that uses an alternate DNS name for the
	  master, aka "AltNames Vulnerability."

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2.7.6-1~bpo60+1.
