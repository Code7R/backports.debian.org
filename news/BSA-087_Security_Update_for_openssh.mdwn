	Colin Watson uploaded new packages for openssh which fixed the following
	security problems:

	CVE-2013-4548
	  A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the post-authentication
	  sshd process when an AES-GCM cipher (aes128-gcm@openssh.com or
	  aes256-gcm@openssh.com) is selected during kex exchange.

	  If exploited, this vulnerability might permit code execution with the
	  privileges of the authenticated user and may therefore allow bypassing
	  restricted shell/command configurations.

	For the wheezy-backports distribution, this problem has been fixed in
	version 1:6.4p1-1~bpo70+1.

	For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
	has been fixed in version 1:6.4p1-1.

	Other distributions are not vulnerable.
