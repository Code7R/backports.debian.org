	Cyril Lavier uploaded new packages for nginx which fixed the
	following security problems:

	DSA-2434-1 nginx -- sensitive information leak

	Matthew Daley discovered a memory disclosure vulnerability in nginx. In
	previous versions of this web server, an attacker can receive the
	content of previously freed memory if an upstream server returned a
	specially crafted HTTP response, potentially exposing sensitive
	information.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version

	    1.1.17-2~bpo60+1

	For wheezy (testing) and sid (unstable) this was fixed in version

	    1.1.17-2

	For squeeze (stable), this was fixed in version

	    0.7.67-3+squeeze2
