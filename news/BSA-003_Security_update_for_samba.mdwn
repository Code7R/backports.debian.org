	Christian Perrier uploaded new packages for samba which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-3069
	  A vulnerability has been discovered in samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
	  print, and login server for Unix.

	  The sid_parse() function does not correctly check its input lengths
	  when reading a binary representation of a Windows SID (Security ID).
	  This allows a malicious client to send a sid that can overflow the
	  stack variable that is being used to store the SID in the Samba smbd
	  server.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2:3.5.5~dfsg-1~bpo50+1.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
