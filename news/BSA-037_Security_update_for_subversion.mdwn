	Peter Samuelson uploaded new packages for subversion which fixed the
	following security problems:
	
	CVE-2011-1752
	  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will dereference
	  a NULL pointer if asked to deliver baselined WebDAV resources.
	  http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1752-advisory.txt
	
	CVE-2011-1783
	  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module may in certain
	  scenarios enter a logic loop which does not exit and which allocates
	  memory in each iteration, ultimately exhausting all the available
	  memory on the server.
	  http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1783-advisory.txt
	
	CVE-2011-1921
	  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module may leak to
	  remote users the file contents of files configured to be unreadable
	  by those users.
	  http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1921-advisory.txt
	
	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.12dfsg-6~bpo50+1.
	
	For the stable distribution (squeeze) the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.12dfsg-6 [stable-sec].
	
	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>
	
	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository to
	200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.
	
	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
