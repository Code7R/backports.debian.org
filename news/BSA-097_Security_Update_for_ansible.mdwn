	Harlan Lieberman-Berg uploaded new packages for ansible which fixed
	the following security problems:

	CVE-2014-4966
	  A bug was discovered by Brian Harring that could allow for the
	  escalation of a local permission access level into an arbitrary code
	  execution, by interpolation of maliciously crafted file names.

	CVE-2014-4967
	  A bug was discovered by Brian Harring concerning the unsafe parsing
	  of action arguments when an attacker can control any variable data,
	  including fact data, with_fileglob data, and others.  Depending on
	  what module the attacker targets, the impact ranges from information
	  disclosure to arbitrary shell code execution.

	For the wheezy-backports distribution, these problems have been fixed
	in version 1.6.8+dfsg-1~bpo70+1.

	The stable distribution (wheezy) was not affected by this issue.

	For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
	problems have been fixed in version 1.6.8+dfsg-1.
