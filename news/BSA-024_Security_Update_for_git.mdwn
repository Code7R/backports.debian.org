	Sebastian Harl uploaded new packages for git which fixed the following
	security problem:

	CVE-2010-3906, Debian Bug #607248
	  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gitweb 1.7.3.3 and earlier
	  allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
	  (1) f and (2) fp parameters.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problem has been fixed in
	version 1:1.7.2.3-2.2~bpo50+1.

	For the oldstable (lenny) distribution the problem has been fixed in
	version 1:1.5.6.5-3+lenny3.3.

	For the stable (squeeze), testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid)
	distributions the problem has been fixed in version 1:1.7.2.3-2.2.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
