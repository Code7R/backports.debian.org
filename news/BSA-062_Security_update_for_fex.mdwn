	Kilian Krause uploaded new packages for fex which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2012-0869, CVE-2012-1293 (see also DSA 2414-1 and 2412-2)

	Nicola Fioravanti discovered that F*EX, a web service for transferring
	very large files, is not properly sanitizing input parameters of the "fup"
	script.  An attacker can use this flaw to conduct reflected cross-site
	scripting attacks via various script parameters.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 20120215-3~bpo60+1.

	The Debian stable and unstable distribution are already fixed, testing (wheezy)
	will receive this update in the next days.

	We recommend that you upgrade your fex packages.
