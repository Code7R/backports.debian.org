	Matt Taggart uploaded new packages for wordpress which fixed the
	following security problem:

	Critical core security bug in the HTML sanitation library
	  more info: http://wp.me/pZhYe-qt

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.0.4+dfsg-1~bpo50+1.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository to
	200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
