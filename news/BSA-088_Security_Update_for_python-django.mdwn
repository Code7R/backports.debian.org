	Dominic Hargreaves uploaded new packages for python-django which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2013-6044

	Nick Brunn reported a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability in
	python-django, a high-level Python web development framework.

	The is_safe_url utility function used to validate that a used URL is on
	the current host to avoid potentially dangerous redirects from
	maliciously-constructed querystrings, worked as intended for HTTP and
	HTTPS URLs, but permitted redirects to other schemes, such as
	javascript:.

	The is_safe_url function has been modified to properly recognize and
	reject URLs which specify a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS, to prevent
	cross-site scripting attacks through redirecting to other schemes.

	CVE-2013-4315

	Rainer Koirikivi discovered a directory traversal vulnerability with
	'ssi' template tags in python-django, a high-level Python web
	development framework.

	It was shown that the handling of the 'ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS' setting,
	used to represent allowed prefixes for the {% ssi %} template tag, is
	vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, by specifying a file path
	which begins as the absolute path of a directory in
	'ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS', and then uses relative paths to break free.

	To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be in a position to alter
	templates on the site, or the site to be attacked must have one or more
	templates making use of the 'ssi' tag, and must allow some form of
	unsanitized user input to be used as an argument to the 'ssi' tag.

	CVE-2013-1443

	It was discovered that python-django, a high-level Python web
	develompent framework, is prone to a denial of service vulnerability
	via large passwords.

	A non-authenticated remote attacker could mount a denial of service by
	submitting arbitrarily large passwords, tying up server resources in
	the expensive computation of the corresponding hashes to verify the
	password.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.4.5-1+deb7u4~bpo60+1.
