	Gunnar Wolf uploaded new packages for Drupal7 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE 2014-3704 / SA-CORE-2014-005:
	   Highly critical: Pre Auth SQL injection

	   The expandArguments function in the database abstraction API in
	   Drupal core 7.x before 7.32 does not properly construct prepared
	   statements, which allows remote attackers to conduct SQL injection
	   attacks via an array containing crafted keys.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in

	For the wheezy-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 7.32-1~bpo70+1.
