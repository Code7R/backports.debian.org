	Peter Samuelson uploaded new packages for subversion which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-3315
	  When "SVNPathAuthz short_circuit" is enabled, authz authentication in
	  the mod_dav_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server is flawed. Remote
	  authenticated users can bypass intended access restrictions via svn
	  commands.

	  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3315

	For the lenny-backports distribution, the problem has been fixed in
	version 1.6.12dfsg-2~bpo50+1.

	For the current testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, the
	problem has been fixed in version 1.6.12dfsg-2.

	Upgrade instructions
	- --------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
