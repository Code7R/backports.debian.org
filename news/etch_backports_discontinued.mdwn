Hi, 
since security support for Debian Etch (4.0) is discontinued on Februrary
15th [1] etch-backports will close its doors the same day.

What does that mean?

* No uploads to etch-backports are allowed after this date
* Downloads will still be available, but every user is recommended to
  update to Debian Lenny / lenny-backports.

Just some numbers:

etch backports had 528 (source) backports with ~ 1300 accepted uploads.
I have to say "Thank you" to every contributor without your work
backports.org wouldn't be possible.

Thanks for you attention
Alex - backports.org ftp-master
