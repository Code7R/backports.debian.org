	Andreas Metzler  uploaded new packages for gnutls28 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2014-1959 / DSA 2866-1 / GNUTLS-SA-2014-1
	  Suman Jana reported that GnuTLS, deviating from the documented
	  behavior considers a version 1 intermediate certificate as a CA
	  certificate by default.

	(sid), this problem has been fixed in gnutls26/2.12.23-12 and
	gnutls28/3.2.11-1.

	gnutls26/2.12.20-8.
