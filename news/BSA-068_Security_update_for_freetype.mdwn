	Paul Wise uploaded new packages for freetype which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-3439
	        FreeType allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
	        cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted
	        font, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3256.

	CVE-2011-3256
	        FreeType before 2.4.7 allows remote attackers to execute
	        arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption)
	        via a crafted font, a different vulnerability than
	        CVE-2011-0226.

	CVE-2011-0226
	        Integer signedness error in psaux/t1decode.c in FreeType before
	        2.4.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
	        a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)
	        via a crafted Type 1 font.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2.4.8-1~bpo60+1.
