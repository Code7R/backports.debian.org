	Evgeni Golov uploaded new packages for mutt which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2014-0467 / DSA-2874-1
	  Beatrice Torracca and Evgeni Golov discovered a buffer overflow in the
	  mutt mailreader. Malformed RFC2047 header lines could result in denial
	  of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.5.21-6.2+deb7u2~bpo60+1.

	For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1.5.20-9+squeeze3.

	For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1.5.21-6.2+deb7u2.

	For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1.5.22-2.

	We recommend that you upgrade your mutt packages.
