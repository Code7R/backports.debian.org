	Alexander Reichle-Schmehl uploaded new packages for nss which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-3170
	        NSS recognizes a wildcard IP address in the subject's Common
	        Name field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow
	        man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via
	        a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
	        Authority.

	CVE-2010-3173
	        NSS does not properly set the minimum key length for
	        Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) mode, which makes it easier for
	        remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
	        via a brute-force attack.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.12.8-1~bpo50+1.


	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
