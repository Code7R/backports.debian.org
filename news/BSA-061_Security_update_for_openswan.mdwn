	Harald Jenny uploaded new packages for openswan which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-4073
	  Use-after-free vulnerability in the cryptographic helper handler
	  functionality in Openswan 2.3.0 through 2.6.36 allows remote
	  authenticated users to cause a denial of service (pluto IKE daemon
	  crash) via vectors related to the (1) quick_outI1_continue and (2)
	  quick_outI1 functions.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1:2.6.28+dfsg-5+squeeze1~bpo50+1.

	For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1:2.4.12+dfsg-1.3+lenny3.

	For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1:2.6.28+dfsg-5+squeeze1.

	For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
	version 1:2.6.37-1.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
