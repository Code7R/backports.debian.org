	Willem Pinckaers discovered that Tor, a tool to enable online anonymity,
	does not correctly handle all data read from the network.  By supplying
	specially crafted packets a remote attacker can cause Tor to overflow
	its heap, crashing the process in turn.  Arbitrary code execution has
	not been confirmed but also cannot be ruled out completely.

	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
	CVE-2010-1676 to this issue.

	For the lenny-backports archive this problem has been fixed in
	version 0.2.1.26-6~bpo50+1.

	For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
	version 0.2.1.26-1~lenny+3 (DSA-2136-1).

	For the testing distribution (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid)
	this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.26-6.

	Upgrade instructions
	- --------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository to
	200 so that new versions of installed backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
