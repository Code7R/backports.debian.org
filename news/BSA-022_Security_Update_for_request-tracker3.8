	Jan Wagner uploaded new packages for request-tracker3.8 which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2011-0009
	  It was discovered that Request Tracker, an issue tracking system,
	  stored passwords in its database by using an insufficiently strong
	  hashing method. If an attacker would have access to the password
	  database, he could decode the passwords stored in it.

	  http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0009

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.8.8-7~bpo50+1.

	For the unstable (sid) distribution, the problem has been fixed in version
	3.8.8-7, for testing (squeeze) the fix should follow soon.

	Upgrade instructions
	----------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
