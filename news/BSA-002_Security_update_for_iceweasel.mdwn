	Alexander Reichle-Schmehl uploaded new packages for iceweasel which
	fixed the following security problems:

	CVE-2010-3169:

	  Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla
	  Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before 3.0.7
	  and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 allow remote
	  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
	  application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown
	  vectors.

	CVE-2010-2765:

	  Integer overflow in the FRAMESET element implementation in Mozilla
	  Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before 3.0.7
	  and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 might allow remote
	  attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large number of values in the
	  cols (aka columns) attribute, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

	CVE-2010-2767:

	  The navigator.plugins implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12
	  and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3,
	  and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 does not properly handle destruction of the
	  DOM plugin array, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
	  of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code via crafted
	  access to the navigator object, related to a "dangling pointer
	  vulnerability."

	CVE-2010-3166:

	  Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsTextFrameUtils::TransformText
	  function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9,
	  Thunderbird before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before
	  2.0.7 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
	  bidirectional text run.

	CVE-2010-2760:

	  Use-after-free vulnerability in the nsTreeSelection function in
	  Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before
	  3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 might allow
	  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a XUL
	  tree selection, related to a "dangling pointer vulnerability." NOTE:
	  this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-2753.

	CVE-2010-3168:

	  Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird
	  before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 do not
	  properly restrict the role of property changes in triggering XUL tree
	  removal, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	  (deleted memory access and application crash) or possibly execute
	  arbitrary code by setting unspecified properties.

	CVE-2010-3167:

	  The nsTreeContentView function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and
	  3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and
	  SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 does not properly handle node removal in XUL
	  trees, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	  vectors involving access to deleted memory, related to a "dangling
	  pointer vulnerability."

	CVE-2010-2766:

	  The normalizeDocument function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and
	  3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and
	  SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 does not properly handle the removal of DOM nodes
	  during normalization, which might allow remote attackers to execute
	  arbitrary code via vectors involving access to a deleted object.

	CVE-2010-2763:

	  The XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper class in the SafeJSObjectWrapper (aka SJOW)
	  implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12, Thunderbird before
	  3.0.7, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 does not properly restrict scripted
	  functions, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
	  Policy and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted
	  function.

	CVE-2010-2768:

	  Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird
	  before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 do not
	  properly restrict use of the type attribute of an OBJECT element to set
	  a document's charset, which allows remote attackers to bypass cross-site
	  scripting (XSS) protection mechanisms via UTF-7 encoding.

	CVE-2010-2769:

	  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox before
	  3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before
	  3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 allows user-assisted remote attackers
	  to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a selection that is added to
	  a document in which the designMode property is enabled.

	CVE-2010-2764:

	  Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12 and 3.6.x before 3.6.9, Thunderbird
	  before 3.0.7 and 3.1.x before 3.1.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 do not
	  properly restrict read access to the statusText property of
	  XMLHttpRequest objects, which allows remote attackers to discover the
	  existence of intranet web servers via cross-origin requests.


	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.5.12-2~bpo50+1.

	For the squeeze and sid distributions the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.5.12-1.


	Upgrade instructions
	- --------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically. 

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
