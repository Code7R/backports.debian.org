	intrigeri uploaded new packages for nss which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2013-1739 (DSA-2790-1)
	  A flaw was found in the way the Mozilla Network Security Service library (nss)
	  read uninitialized data when there was a decryption failure. A remote attacker
	  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash) for
	  applications linked with the nss library.

	CVE-2013-5605 (DSA-2800-1)
	  Andrew Tinits reported a potentially exploitable buffer overflow in the
	  Mozilla Network Security Service library (nss). With a specially crafted
	  request a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute
	  arbitrary code.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 2:3.14.5-1~bpo60+1.

	For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), the problems have been fixed in
	version 3.12.8-1+squeeze7.

	For the stable distribution (wheezy), the problems have been fixed in version
	2:3.14.5-1.

	For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, the problems have
	been fixed in version 2:3.15.3-1.
