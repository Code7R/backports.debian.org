	Rene Engelhard uploaded new packages for openoffice.org which fixed the
	following security problems:

	CVE-2010-2935 CVE-2010-2936:

	 Charlie Miller has discovered two vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org
	 Impress, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
	 user's system and execute arbitrary code.

	    1) An integer truncation error when parsing certain content can be
	    exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
	    crafted file.

	    2) A short integer overflow error when parsing certain content can
	    be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
	    crafted file.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 1:3.2.1-6~bpo50+1.

	For the squeeze and sid distributions the problems have been fixed in
	version 1:3.2.1-6.

	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install openoffice.org" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/>

	We recommend to pin the backports repository to 200 so that new
	versions of installed  backports will be installed automatically.
