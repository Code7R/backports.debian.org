	Patrick Matth√§i <pmatthaei> uploaded new packages for znc which fixed
	the following security problems:

	CVE-2010-2934
	    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in ZNC 0.092 allow remote
	    attackers to cause a denial of service (exception and daemon crash)
	    via unknown vectors related to "unsafe substr() calls."

	CVE-2010-2812
	    Client.cpp in ZNC 0.092 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
	    of service (exception and daemon crash) via a PING command that
	    lacks an argument.

	For the lenny-backports distribution the problems have been fixed in
	version 0.092-3~bpo50+1.


	Upgrade instructions
	--------------------

	If you don't use pinning (see [1]) you have to update the package
	manually via "apt-get -t lenny-backports install <packagelist>" with
	the packagelist of your installed packages affected by this update.
	[1] <http://backports.debian.org/Instructions>

	We recommend to pin (in /etc/apt/preferences) the backports repository
	to 200 so that new versions of installed  backports will be installed
	automatically.

	  Package: *
	  Pin: release a=lenny-backports
	  Pin-Priority: 200
