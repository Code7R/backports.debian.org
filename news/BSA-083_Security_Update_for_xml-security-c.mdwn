	Russ Allbery uploaded new packages for xml-security-c that fixed the
	following security problems discovered by James Forshaw from Context
	Information Security:

	CVE-2013-2153

	    The implementation of XML digital signatures in the Santuario-C++
	    library is vulnerable to a spoofing issue allowing an attacker to
	    reuse existing signatures with arbitrary content.

	CVE-2013-2154

	    A stack overflow, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution,
	    exists in the processing of malformed XPointer expressions in the
	    XML Signature Reference processing code.

	CVE-2013-2155

	    A bug in the processing of the output length of an HMAC-based XML
	    Signature would cause a denial of service when processing specially
	    chosen input.

	CVE-2013-2156

	    A heap overflow exists in the processing of the PrefixList attribute
	    optionally used in conjunction with Exclusive Canonicalization,
	    potentially allowing arbitary code execution.

	For the squeeze-backports distribution, the problems have been fixed in
	version 1.6.1-5+deb7u1~bpo60+1.

	We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages, particularly
	libxml-security-c16, if it was installed via backports.
