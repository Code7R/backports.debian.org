	Colin Watson uploaded new packages for openssh which fixed the following
	security problems:

	CVE-2014-2532 (DSA-2894-1)
	  Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in
	  AcceptEnv lines.  A remote attacker could use this issue to trick
	  OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the
	  characters before the wildcard character.

	CVE-2014-2653 (DSA-2894-1)
	  Matthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a HostCertificate
	  that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client doesn't check the
	  DNS for SSHFP records.  As a consequence a malicious server can
	  disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a certificate.

	  Note that a host verification prompt is still displayed before
	  connecting.
