Hi users,
Hi contributors,

as some of you may heard [1] the security support for sarge will be
terminated on March 31st. This will also be the end of backports.org support
for sarge-backports. Uploads to sarge-backports will not be able any more
after this date, but it will not immediatly removed from our servers, so
downloads will still be possible for some time, but don't expect that this
will be forever!

Now is the time to update to Etch and to start using etch-backports :). If
you are experiencing serious upgrade problems from sarge-backports to
etch-backports, please tell us so that we are able to fix this (if its
serious enough :)).

Thank you all very much for your support of backport.org during sarge's
lifetime!

Alex - ftp-master of backports.org
