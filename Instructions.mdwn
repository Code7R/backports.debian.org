##Add backports to your sources.list 

1. Add this line 
    <pre>deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main</pre>
    to your **sources.list** (or add a new file to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
2. Run **apt-get update**

##Install a package from backports

All backports are deactivated by default (i.e. the packages are pinned to 1 by using NotAutomatic: yes in the Release files, just as in experimental). If you want to install something from backports run:

    apt-get -t lenny-backports install "package"

of course you can use aptitude as well:

     aptitude -t lenny-backports install "package"

##Get packages upgraded from backports.debian.org (Recommended!)

Normally packages won't get upgraded automatically from backports.debian.org (due to the NotAutomatic flag). To get packages that you have installed from backports automatically updated you have to have add a pinning: 

    Package: *
    Pin: release a=lenny-backports
    Pin-Priority: 200

**This setting is recommended** 
**Without this setting you don't get security updates**

##Report Bugs

Please report bugs that you found in the packages to the [backports mailinglist](http://lists.debian.org/debian-backports) and **NOT** to the Debian BTS!
