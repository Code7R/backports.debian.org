## About backports ##

Backports are recompiled packages from testing (mostly) and unstable (in a few
cases only, e.g. security updates) in a stable environment so that they will
run without new libraries (whenever it is possible) on a Debian stable
distribution

Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports
are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other
components in Debian stable. Use with care!

It is therefore recommended to select single backported packages that fit
your needs, and not use all available backports.


##Add backports to your sources.list 

1. Add this line 
    <pre>deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main</pre>
    to your **sources.list** (or add a new file with the ".list" extension to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
2. Run **apt-get update**

##Install a package from backports

All backports are deactivated by default (i.e. the packages are pinned to 100 by using ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes in the Release files. If you want to install something from backports run:

    apt-get -t squeeze-backports install "package"

of course you can use aptitude as well:

    aptitude -t squeeze-backports install "package"

##lenny-backports-sloppy

To guarantee a clean upload path from lenny-backports to squeeze it is not allowed to upload backports from wheezy to lenny-backports. 
To allow new backports also in old-stable we created a new suite for everybody that prefer newer packages above a clean upgrade path:
**lenny-backports-sloppy**. You can use it exactly as lenny-backports, just add another line to your **sources.list** and install 
new packages via
	apt-get -t lenny-backports-sloppy install <packages>
