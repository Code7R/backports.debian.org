##Add backports to your sources.list 

1. Add this line 
    <pre>deb http://www.backports.org/debian lenny-backports main contrib non-free</pre>
    to your **sources.list** (or add a new file to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
2. Run **apt-get update**

##Install a package from backports

All backports are deactivated by default (i.e. the packages are pinned to 1 by using NotAutomatic: yes in the Release files, just as in experimental). If you want to install something from backports run:

    apt-get -t lenny-backports install "package"

of course you can use aptitude as well:

     aptitude -t lenny-backports install "package"

##Use pinning for installation

*Note: this method is not recommended* 

Then you have to set a higher priority for each backport, yes that means every backport, also for every dependency. For mutt, you have to add these lines:

    Package: mutt
    Pin: release a=lenny-backports
    Pin-Priority: 999

to your **/etc/apt/preferences** (if you haven't use pinning before, the file has to be created).

After running *apt-get update* run *apt-get install* mutt as usual. 

##Install the backports.org keyring

If you want apt to verify the downloaded backports you can import backports.org archive's key into apt:

    apt-get install debian-backports-keyring

or

    gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 16BA136C
    gpg --export 16BA136C | apt-key add -

or

    wget -O - http://backports.org/debian/archive.key | apt-key add -

##Get packages upgraded from backports.org

Normally packages won't get upgraded automatically from backports.org (due to the NotAutomatic flag). To get packages that you have installed from bpo automatically updated you have to have add a pinning: 

    Package: *
    Pin: release a=lenny-backports
    Pin-Priority: 200

**This setting is recommended**
