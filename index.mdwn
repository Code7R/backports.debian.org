##Introduction

You are running Debian stable, because you prefer the Debian stable tree. It runs great, there is just one problem: the software is a little bit outdated compared to other distributions. This is where backports come in.

Backports are recompiled packages from testing (mostly) and unstable (in a few cases only, e.g. security updates) in a stable environment so that they will run without new libraries (whenever it is possible) on a Debian stable distribution

Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports
are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other
components in Debian stable. Use with care!

It is therefore recommended to select single backported packages that fit
your needs, and not use all available backports.
