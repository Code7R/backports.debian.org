##Introduction

You are running Debian stable, because you prefer the Debian stable tree. It runs great, there is just one problem: the software is a little bit outdated compared to other distributions. This is where backports come in.

Backports are packages from taken from the next Debian release (called
"testing"), adjusted and recompiled for usage on Debian stable. Because the
package is also present in the next Debian release, you can easily upgrade your
stable+backports system once the next Debian release comes out. (In a few
cases, usually for security updates, backports are also created from the Debian
unstable distribution.)

Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and backports
are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other
components in Debian stable. Use with care!

It is therefore recommended to only select single backported packages that fit
your needs, and not use all available backports.
